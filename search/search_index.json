Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the path of an object launched into the air and influenced only by gravity (no air resistance). When an object is projected with an initial speed \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) above the horizontal, its motion can be broken into two components: Horizontal velocity : \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\) Vertical velocity : \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) Gravity only affects the vertical motion. Using physics equations of motion, the path of the projectile is a parabola. Time of Flight (assuming launch and landing at the same height): \\[ T = \\frac{2v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Horizontal Range : \\[ \\[ \\begin{aligned} R &= v_{0x} \\cdot T \\\\ &= v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\\\ &= \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\end{aligned} \\] \\] This equation shows that the range depends on both the speed and the angle of launch. Key Insight : The maximum range is achieved at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) The range is symmetric: angles that add to \\(90^\\circ\\) (like \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) ) give the same range. 2. Analysis of the Range How does the angle affect the range? When angle is too small, the object moves more horizontally but doesn't stay in the air long. When angle is too steep, it goes high but not far. \\(45^\\circ\\) gives the perfect balance for maximum horizontal distance. Influence of Other Parameters: Initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : The range increases quadratically with speed. Doubling the speed makes the range four times longer. Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : Range is inversely related to gravity. On the Moon, with lower gravity, the same throw would go farther. Initial height ( \\(h\\) ) : If launched from above ground level, the range increases because the object stays in the air longer. 3. Practical Applications Projectile motion isn\u2019t just academic\u2014it appears in: Sports : Calculating the optimal angle to throw a ball or kick a football. Engineering : Designing projectiles or launch systems (e.g., missiles, fireworks). Astrophysics : Determining orbits and escape trajectories for spacecraft. Games and Simulations : Animating realistic motion of objects. In real life , we also must account for: Air resistance (slows the object down) Wind (can push the object off course) Spin or lift effects (e.g., Magnus effect on spinning balls) 4. Summary of Key Points The range of a projectile depends on its launch angle and initial speed. Without air resistance, the formula \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] accurately describes the range. - Maximum range occurs at \\(45^\\circ\\) on flat ground. - Real-world conditions (drag, wind, terrain) change the result and require more advanced modeling. ## colab problem","title":"Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1-investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"Projectile motion describes the path of an object launched into the air and influenced only by gravity (no air resistance).

Depending on these conditions, the payload may reenter the atmosphere, enter orbit, or escape Earth\u2019s gravitational field entirely. This problem is central to satellite deployment, space station servicing, and interplanetary mission planning. To understand and predict these trajectories, we combine Newtonian gravity with numerical simulation. This enables the classification and analysis of different orbital regimes and helps visualize the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. \ud83e\udde0 Theoretical Background The motion of the payload is governed by Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion. The gravitational force acting on the payload is: \\[ \\vec{F} = -\\frac{G M_e m}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] Where: \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant \\(M_e\\) is the mass of Earth \\(m\\) is the mass of the payload \\(r\\) is the distance from Earth\u2019s center \\(\\hat{r}\\) is the unit vector pointing from the payload to Earth\u2019s center Using Newton\u2019s Second Law, \\(\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}\\) , we derive the equation of motion: \\[ \\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -\\frac{G M_e}{|\\vec{r}|^3} \\vec{r} \\] This vector differential equation describes how the position vector \\(\\vec{r}\\) evolves over time due to Earth\u2019s gravity. The nature of the resulting trajectory depends on the magnitude and direction of the payload\u2019s velocity at release. Types of Trajectories The form of the trajectory depends on the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) of the payload: Circular Orbit Occurs when the payload has just enough velocity to maintain a constant distance from Earth. The required circular velocity is: \\[ v_\\text{circular} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_e}{r}} \\] Elliptical Orbit If the velocity is less than escape velocity but not tuned for a circular path, the payload follows an elliptical orbit. Parabolic Escape Trajectory If the payload has exactly the escape velocity: \\[ v_\\text{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_e}{r}} \\] It follows a parabolic path and asymptotically escapes Earth\u2019s gravity. Hyperbolic Trajectory When the velocity exceeds the escape velocity, the payload follows an open, hyperbolic path and escapes with residual speed. Suborbital (Reentry) If the payload has insufficient velocity for a stable orbit, it eventually returns to Earth\u2019s surface. \ud83e\uddee Numerical Simulation Analytically solving the gravitational equations of motion is only feasible for idealized cases. For arbitrary initial conditions and realistic mission scenarios, numerical simulation is required. The trajectory of the payload is determined by integrating the second-order differential equation: \\[ \\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -\\frac{G M_e}{|\\vec{r}|^3} \\vec{r} \\] This is reformulated as a system of first-order differential equations by introducing the velocity vector \\(\\vec{v} = \\dot{\\vec{r}}\\) . The numerical solver then steps through small time increments, updating position and velocity based on the local acceleration caused by Earth\u2019s gravity. Key parameters for simulation: Initial Position : Defined by the altitude of release above Earth's surface. Initial Velocity : Both magnitude and direction affect the outcome. Integration Time : Determines how far the simulation runs into the future. Using a standard ODE integrator, such as Runge-Kutta methods, we simulate the motion and track the trajectory in 2D space. The Earth is modeled as a stationary massive body, and atmospheric drag is neglected for simplicity. \ud83d\udd2c Example Simulations and Interpretation To demonstrate the different types of trajectories, we simulate the release of a payload from 300 km above Earth\u2019s surface, changing only the magnitude of the initial velocity while keeping the direction tangential to the surface. Let: \\[ r = R_e + h, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad R_e = \\text{Earth\u2019s radius}, \\quad h = 300\\,\\text{km} \\] Then: \\[ v_\\text{circular} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_e}{r}}, \\quad v_\\text{escape} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot v_\\text{circular} \\] We analyze four distinct cases: 1. Circular Orbit Velocity : Exactly \\(v_\\text{circular}\\) Result : The payload enters a stable circular orbit, maintaining constant altitude. 2. Suborbital Reentry Velocity : Less than \\(v_\\text{circular}\\) , e.g., 70% of it Result : The payload follows a curved path but lacks the velocity to sustain orbit and eventually reenters Earth\u2019s atmosphere. 3.

When two or more waves meet on a surface (like water), they combine. This combination is called interference . It can happen in two main ways: Constructive interference : Waves add together to make a larger wave. Destructive interference : Waves cancel each other out, resulting in a flat surface. On a water surface, this can be seen as bright and dark patterns\u2014like ripples overlapping. \ud83d\udcd0 Choosing a Setup: Regular Polygon Let\u2019s use a square as our regular polygon. That means we place 4 identical wave sources at the corners of a square. Each one sends out circular waves on the water. \ud83d\udcd8 Wave Equation (From One Source) Each point source creates a wave described by: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{r} \\cos(kr - \\omega t + \\phi) \\] Where: \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) : Height of the wave at point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) \\(A\\) : Amplitude of the wave \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) : Distance from the source at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to the point \\((x, y)\\) \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) : Wave number, related to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) : Angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) \\(\\phi\\) : Initial phase (can be the same for all sources) \ud83e\udde0 Superposition of Waves If we have 4 sources (like in the square), the total wave height at any point is the sum of the waves from each source: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \\eta_1 + \\eta_2 + \\eta_3 + \\eta_4 \\] This means we just add up the contributions from each source, based on how far each one is from the point we\u2019re looking at. \ud83c\udfa8 What Does the Pattern Look Like? The result is a complex interference pattern that looks like ripples overlapping in a structured way. What you\u2019ll see: Symmetrical patterns, matching the square shape Regions of high wave height ( constructive interference ), forming bright lobes or rings Regions of low or zero wave height ( destructive interference ), where the waves cancel each other This pattern stays steady in space (assuming time is fixed), and it changes dynamically if you let time move. \ud83d\udd0d Real-World Applications Sonar and radar systems use interference patterns to detect objects Optics : Similar patterns happen with light in double-slit experiments Acoustics : Speaker setups in rooms create interference zones colab solution","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1-interference-patterns-on-a-water-surface","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udcd8 Problem 1: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#what-is-interference","text":"When two or more waves meet on a surface (like water), they combine.
